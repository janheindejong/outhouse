# Outhouse application 

This is a simple idea for an app, that allows you and your family members to manage everything related to your family outhouse. Think of things like having a shared calender, budgetting, shopping and to-do list, guestbo, you name it. 

It consists of a React front-end, a Python + FastAPI back-end, and for now a very very simple SQLite database. For now, I'll simply deploy to my own k8s cluster, but in future, we could run this on some cloud based service like AWS.
